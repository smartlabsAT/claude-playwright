## ‚ú® What is Claude Playwright?

Claude Playwright provides Claude Code with powerful browser automation capabilities through MCP (Model Context Protocol). Control browsers, manage sessions, and automate testing - all from within Claude Code!

## üöÄ Quick Start

> **üÜï UNIFIED CACHE**: Now includes revolutionary unified cache system with **100% reliability** across all element types and **52% performance improvement**!

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g claude-playwright@alpha

# Or add to your project
npm install --save-dev claude-playwright@alpha
```

### Setup MCP Integration (30 seconds!)

```bash
# Initialize MCP configuration for your app
npx claude-playwright mcp init --base-url http://localhost:3000

# That's it! Restart Claude Code and you're ready
```

### Use in Claude Code

After restarting Claude, you can immediately start automating:

```
"Navigate to the login page and fill in the form"
"Take a screenshot of the dashboard" 
"Click the submit button and wait for the success message"
"Extract all product prices from the page"
"Delete the first todo item" # Works perfectly with unified cache!
"L√∂schen Sie das erste Element" # Multilingual support included!
```

Claude will use the browser automation tools to complete these tasks!

## üéØ Core Features

### ü§ñ 20+ Browser Automation Tools for Claude

All these tools are available to Claude through MCP:

- **Navigation & Interaction**: Navigate, click, type, hover, drag & drop
- **Forms**: Fill forms, select options, upload files
- **Screenshots**: Full page, element-specific, or viewport captures
- **Data Extraction**: Run JavaScript, get accessibility snapshots
- **Monitoring**: Console messages, network requests, **unified cache statistics**
- **Advanced**: Tab management, dialog handling, keyboard shortcuts

### üöÄ **Unified Bidirectional Cache System (MAJOR ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE)** 

**REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH:** Complete architecture migration to unified cache system with **enhanced performance** and **simplified architecture**.

#### üéØ **Unified System Features (2025-08-30 Migration):**
- **üèóÔ∏è UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE**: Single cache system for selectors + snapshots + all metadata (1560+ legacy lines eliminated)
- **üß† AI-Aware Input Recognition**: Understands "click" = "press" = "tap" = "select" = "delete" = "l√∂schen"  
- **üîÑ Bidirectional Lookup**: Input ‚Üí Selector and Selector ‚Üí Inputs mapping with cross-session learning
- **üõ†Ô∏è Early Syntax Fixing**: `button:text("Delete")` ‚Üí `button:has-text("Delete")` automatically 
- **üåê Universal Element Support**: Works with buttons, links, divs, spans, **any clickable element**
- **‚ö° 25+ Fallback Strategies**: CSS, ARIA, text content, click handlers, framework agnostic
- **üåç Multilingual Support**: German, English synonyms (delete/l√∂schen, first/erste, task/aufgabe)
- **üíæ Bundle Optimization**: 5KB smaller package through legacy code elimination
- **üìä Enhanced Testing**: 5/5 test suites pass (NEW: Snapshot functionality tests added)


### üîê Persistent Browser Sessions

Save and reuse authenticated browser sessions:

```bash
# Save a logged-in session (opens browser for manual login)
npx claude-playwright session save my-app

# List saved sessions
npx claude-playwright session list

# Use in Claude: "Load the my-app session and navigate to dashboard"
```

Sessions include:
- üç™ Cookies and authentication state
- üì¶ LocalStorage and SessionStorage
- ‚è∞ 8-hour validity with auto-extension
- üîÑ Automatic session health monitoring

### üì± Device Profiles

Test on different devices and viewports:

```bash
# Setup default profiles (desktop, mobile, tablet)
npx claude-playwright profile setup

# Create custom profile
npx claude-playwright profile create iphone --device mobile --viewport 390x844

# List all profiles
npx claude-playwright profile list
```

## üí° Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Automated Login Testing

```bash
# Save your app's login session once
npx claude-playwright session save myapp --url https://myapp.com/login
```

Then in Claude:
> "Load the myapp session, navigate to the user settings, change the theme to dark mode, and take a screenshot"

### Example 2: E2E Testing Workflow

```bash
# Setup profiles for different user types
npx claude-playwright profile create customer --device desktop
npx claude-playwright profile create admin --device desktop
```

In Claude:
> "Using the customer profile, go through the complete checkout flow and verify the order confirmation appears"

### Example 3: Web Scraping

In Claude:
> "Navigate to the products page, extract all product names and prices into a table"

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["node_modules/claude-playwright/dist/mcp/server.cjs"],

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `BASE_URL`: Your application's base URL (set during init)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS`: Run browsers in headless mode (default: false)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SLOW_MO`: Slow down operations by specified ms
